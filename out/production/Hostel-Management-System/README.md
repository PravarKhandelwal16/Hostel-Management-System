## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PravarKhandelwal16/Hostel-Management-System.git
   cd Hostel-Management-System
   ```

2. **Open in your preferred Java IDE**  
   (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, etc.)

3. **Add dependencies / libraries**  
   - If you use an external library (for database, UI, etc.), include them in your build path  
   - If using Maven/Gradle, run `mvn install` / `gradle build`  

4. **Configure data storage / database**  
   - If you use a relational database (e.g. MySQL, SQLite), set up the DB schema, update connection configs  
   - If using file-based storage, ensure the application has write permissions  

5. **Run the application**  
   Launch `MainFrame.java` (or equivalent) to start the GUI.

## Usage

1. On launch, the dashboard shows summary information: number of students, rooms, leaves, etc.  
2. Use the sidebar or menu to navigate modules — e.g. Students, Rooms, Visitors, Leaves, Complaints, Notices.  
3. Add / edit / delete entries as needed.  
4. In the Leave module, students can raise leave requests; admin can approve/reject.  
5. Post notices for students; view visitor logs; manage room allotments, etc.

*(You may include screenshots here to show the GUI and workflows.)*
